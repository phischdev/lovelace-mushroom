## What is mushroom-better-sliders?
This is a fork of the fantastic [Mushrooms UI Cards][original-repo] by piitaya, a collection of cards for [Home Assistant][home-assistant] Dashboard UI.

> :warning: **This mod will not work, if you still have the original Mushroom installed**

It focuses on making the sliders more touch friendly.

1. Sliders move on reduced speed when dragged by a finger (easier to hit small values)
2. Sliders can be dragged from any point on the slider (like in iOS Home)
3. Sliders apply live changes to your devices (except turning them off)
2. Explicitly makes it easier to hit 1%

## Installation

### HACS

Mushroom Better Sliders is available in [HACS][hacs] (Home Assistant Community Store).

1. Install HACS if you don't have it already
2. Open HACS in Home Assistant
3. Go to "Frontend" section
4. Click button with "+" icon
5. Search for "Mushroom Better Sliders"

### Manual

1. Download repository and build `mushroom.js`. Instructions are in the [original repo][original-repo].
2. Put `mushroom.js` file into your `config/www` folder.
3. Add reference to `mushroom.js` in Dashboard. There's two way to do that:
    - **Using UI:** _Settings_ ‚Üí _Dashboards_ ‚Üí _More Options icon_ ‚Üí _Resources_ ‚Üí _Add Resource_ ‚Üí Set _Url_ as `/local/mushroom.js` ‚Üí Set _Resource type_ as `JavaScript Module`.
      **Note:** If you do not see the Resources menu, you will need to enable _Advanced Mode_ in your _User Profile_
    - **Using YAML:** Add following code to `lovelace` section.
        ```yaml
        resources:
            - url: /local/mushroom.js
              type: module
        ```

## Usage

### Theme customization

Mushroom works without theme but you can add a theme for better experience by installing the [Mushroom Themes](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom-themes). If you want more information about themes, check out the official [Home Assistant documentation about themes][home-assitant-theme-docs].

## Development server

### Home assistant demo

You can run a demo instance of Home Assistant with docker by running:

```sh
npm run start:hass
```

Once it's done, go to Home Assistant instance [http://localhost:8123](http://localhost:8123) and start configuration.

#### Windows Users

If you are on Windows, either run the above command in Powershell, or use the below if using Command Prompt:

```sh
npm run start:hass-cmd
```

### Development

In another terminal, install dependencies and run development server:

```sh
npm install
npm start
```

Server will start on port `4000`.

### Build

You can build the `mushroom.js` file in `dist` folder by running the build command.

```sh
npm run build
```

### Maintainer steps to add a new language

1. To be compatible with Home Assistant, language tags have to follow [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/bcp47). A list of most language tags can be found here: [IANA subtag registry](http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry). Examples: `fr`, `fr-CA`, `zh-Hans`.
2. Create a new file `{language_code}.json` with your language code in the [translation folder](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/tree/main/src/translations). Examples: `fr.json`.
3. Import your file into the [`localize.ts file`](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom/blob/main/src/localize.ts) and add your language in the `languages` record.
4. Don't forget to test locally with the development server by choosing the language with the Home Assistant UI in your profile.

## Troubleshooting

### I don't see the last changes

1. Check that your Home Assistant version is the latest. Some new Mushroom features can only be visible for the latest Home Assistant version.
2. Check that you have the latest Mushroom version
3. Clear your cache :
    - delete mushroom resources (https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/lovelace_resources/)
    - uninstall Mushroom from HACS
    - reinstall Mushroom from HACS
